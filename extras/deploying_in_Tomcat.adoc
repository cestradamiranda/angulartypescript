.Deploying an Angular app under the Tomcat server
****************
One of the most popular Web server among Java developers is Tomcat. Here's what you need to do to deploy an Angular app there:

1. Build the bundles specifying the current directory as the base of your app (note the period at the end):
+
[source, sh]
----
ng build --prod --base-href .
----
+
This will build the bundles into the dist directory of your project. 

2. Copy the dist directory of your Angular project to the webapps/ROOT dir of your Tomcat installation directory.

3. Start Tomcat and open the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:8080/dist
